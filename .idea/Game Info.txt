Everyone is boring with a capacity for magics, some with a higher ability than others
speed is applied per type of move (fire for magic, sword for physical etc) and allows those moves to go first and possibly multiple times at once
entities can go multiple times if the speed of a move is at least a 2x the enemy's move
-change Story from arrays to arraylists
-changing items has to handle the loss of stats from one item then the gaining of stats from another(may do this for defensive stats only)
-moves should return the amount of damage they do, and will take in players items for that calculation
-method to ask for the players name, probably called as part of the story, possibly a characer asking for their name
